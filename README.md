# Java Maven

Java Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It provides a way to manage project dependencies, build processes, and project documentation.

## Maven Commands

Here are some commonly used Maven commands:

- `mvn clean`: Cleans the project by deleting the target directory.
- `mvn compile`: Compiles the source code of the project.
- `mvn test`: Runs the unit tests for the project.
- `mvn package`: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.
- `mvn install`: Installs the packaged artifact into the local Maven repository.
- `mvn deploy`: Deploys the packaged artifact to a remote Maven repository.

For a complete list of Maven commands and their usage, refer to the [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
